			<p id="intro">
				<b>Subhash Chandra Bose</b> was one of the most celebrated freedom fighters of India. He was a
				charismatic influencer of the youth and earned the epithet ‘Netaji’ by establishing and leading the
				Indian National Army (INA) during India’s struggle for independence. Although initially aligned with the
				Indian National Congress, he was ousted from the party due to his difference in ideology. He sought
				assistance from Nazi leadership in Germany and Imperial forces in Japan during the World War II, to
				overthrow the British from India. His sudden disappearance post 1945, led to surfacing of various
				theories, concerning the possibilities of his survival.
